# Task at hand
Imagine you're tasked with creating a simple web application for a local animal shelter to manage their donation inventory. This shelter is in need of a user-friendly tool to accurately record and track the inflow of donations. The application should be created using your frontend framework of choice to demonstrate your frontend development skills.

Core Functionalities

Donation Input Form:

Create a form where users can input details of a donation.
Fields to include: donor's name, type of donation (money, food, clothing, etc.), quantity or amount donated, and the date of the donation.
Donation List:

Display a list of recorded donations with their details.
Include a way to edit or delete a donation from the list.
Allow users to filter donations based on their type (e.g., money, food, clothing) and see a summary of donations for a specific type.
Donation Statistics:

Show basic statistics of the donations, including the total amount donated and the number of donations.

Additional Notes
Apply basic validation to prevent empty submissions and errors.
Include comments to explain your code.
Ensure the code is well-organized and easy to understand.
You can use local state to manage donations and data without the requirement for server-side or database operations. 
There is no need to create a complex frontend; all functionality can exist on a single page.
Our evaluation will be focused on functionality, so focus time and energy on the core functionalities rather than design.
This problem is expected to take 1-2 hours to complete, however free to spend more time if you wish to add bonus features or refine your solution.
Submission

Along with your code + comments, we'd appreciate clear instructions on how to run the code.

Remember, this exercise is not about checking boxes, but about allowing you the freedom to demonstrate your unique strengths and approach to problem-solving. We're excited to see what you can create!
